# FinExtract: Your AI-Powered Bank Statement Analyzer 📖✨

## Overview

FinExtract is a Streamlit-based web application designed to simplify the process of extracting meaningful information from your bank statements. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI model 🤖, FinExtract analyzes your bank statement PDFs to provide key insights, financial summaries, and interactive visualizations.

## Inspiration 🤔

The inspiration for FinExtract came from the need to quickly and easily make sense of the often complex information presented in bank statements. Manually reviewing and extracting key financial data points from very long bank statements can be time-consuming and error-prone 😫. I aimed to create a tool that would automate this process, providing users with a clear overview of their financial activities and trends using state-of-the-art AI 🚀.

## Key Features 🌟

-   **Comprehensive data extraction:** 📊 Extract key data points including:
    -   Bank Name, Customer Name, and Account Number.
    -   Statement Start Date, Statement End Date.
    -   Starting Balance, Total Money In, Total Money Out, Ending Balance.
    -   Detailed Transaction Information (Date, Description, Money In, Money Out, Balance).
-   **Financial summary generation:** 📝 Get a detailed financial summary generated by Gemini, providing insights into financial health, income, spending, and recommendations in well-formatted bullet points.

## How I Built It 🏗️

This project was built using Python 🐍, leveraging several key libraries:

1.  **Data Extraction:** `pdfplumber` was used to extract text from PDF bank statements.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The extracted text was sent to the Gemini API, which was used for data parsing, financial analysis, and generating text summaries.
3.  **Data Manipulation:** The data from Gemini was cleaned and organized using `pandas` DataFrames.
4.  **Visualization:** `plotly.express` was used to generate interactive charts.
5.  **Report Generation:** `reportlab` was used for creating well-formatted PDF reports.
6.  **User Interface:** Streamlit was used for the user interface, allowing users to easily upload files and interact with their data, enhanced with styling made possible by **Codebuff**.
7.  **Modal video:** `streamlit-modal` was used to show users a video, like Nethenoob's spinning cat 🐈‍⬛, while data is being analyzed.

## Challenges Faced 🚧

During the development of FinExtract, I encountered several challenges:

-   **Handling Varied PDF Formats:** 📄 Bank statements come in various formats, making reliable data extraction difficult. I had to fine-tune the Gemini API prompts to handle diverse layouts and text patterns.
-   **Gemini Response Handling:** 🤖 Getting Gemini to consistently return a structured JSON response with the right data, in the correct format required experimentation with prompt engineering.
-   **Error Handling:** 🐞 Implementing robust error handling to gracefully manage issues during PDF extraction, AI processing, and data parsing required considerable effort.
-   **UI Refinement:** 🎨 Balancing UI complexity with user-friendliness was a continuous effort. I aimed for a clean and intuitive interface despite the complex processing occurring under the hood.
-   **Library Conflicts**: 📚 When using multiple libraries, conflicts can arise, especially with machine learning libraries like torch. Managing this was difficult, but now the requirements are resolved by managing the torch version.

## Running FinExtract Locally 💻

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
